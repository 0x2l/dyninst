\subsection{Class Block}

\definedin{CFG.h}

A Block represents a basic block as defined in Section \ref{sec:abstractions}, and is the lowest level representation of code in the CFG.

\begin{apient}
typedef std::vector<Edge *> edgelist
\end{apient}
\apidesc{Container for edge access. Refer to Section \ref{sec:containers} for details. Library users \emph{must not} rely on the underlying container type of std::vector, as it is subject to change.}

\begin{tabular}{p{1.25in}p{1.125in}p{3.125in}}
	Method name & Return type & Method description \\
	\hline
	name & string & Name of the function. \\
	start & Address & Address of the first instruction in the block. \\
	end & Address & Address immediately following the last instruction in the block. \\
	last & Address & Address of the last instruction in the block. \\
	lastInsnAddr & Address & Alias of \code{last}. \\
	size & Address & Size of the block; \code{end} - \code{start}. \\
	parsed & bool & Whether the block has been parsed. \\
	obj & CodeObject * & CodeObject containing this block. \\
	region & CodeRegion * & CodeRegion containing this block. \\
	sources & const edgelist \& & List of all in-edges to the block. \\
	targets & const edgelist \& & List of all out-edges from the block. \\
	containingFuncs & int & Number of Functions that contain this block. \\
\end{tabular}

\begin{apient}
bool consistent(Address addr, Address & prev_insn)
\end{apient}
\apidesc{Check whether address \code{addr} is \emph{consistent} with this basic block. An address is consistent if it is the boundary between two instructions in the block. As long as \code{addr} is within the range of the block, \code{prev\_insn} will contain the address of the previous instruction boundary before \code{addr}, regardless of whether \code{addr} is consistent or not.}

\begin{apient}
void getFuncs(std::vector<Function *> & funcs)
\end{apient}
\apidesc{Fills in the provided vector with all functions that share this basic block.}

\begin{apient}
template <class OutputIterator>
void getFuncs(OutputIterator result);
\end{apient}
\apidesc{Generic version of the above; adds each Function that contains this block to the provided OutputIterator. For example:}

\begin{apient}
std::set<Function *> funcs;
block->getFuncs(std::inserter(funcs, funcs.begin()));
\end{apient}
