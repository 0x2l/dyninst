\subsection{Class Statement}\label{Statement}

A \code{Statement} is the base representation of line information. 

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
	\hline
	Method name & Return type & Method description \\
	\hline
	startAddr & Offset & Starting address of this line in the file. \\
	endAddr & Offset & Ending address of this line in the file. \\
	getFile & std::string & File that contains the line.   \\
	getLine & unsigned int & Line number. \\
	getColumn & unsigned int & Starting column number. \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

For backwards compatibility, this class may also be referred to as a \code{LineNoTuple}, and provides the following legacy member variables. They should not be used and will be removed in a future version of SymtabAPI. 

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}
	\hline
	Member & Return type & Method description \\
	\hline
	first & const char * & Equivalent to getFile. \\
	second & unsigned int & Equivalent to getLine. \\
	column & unsigned int & Equivalent to getColumn. \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
