\apidesc{
A local variable can be in scope at different positions and based on that it is accessible in different ways. Location lists provide a way to encode that information. 
The method retrieves the location list, specified in terms of \code{VariableLocation} structures (section \ref{VariableLocation}) where the variable is in scope.
