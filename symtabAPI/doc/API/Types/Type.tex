\subsection{Class Type}

The class Type represents the types of variables, parameters, return values, and functions. Instances of this class can represent language predefined types (e.g. int, float), already defined types in the Object File or binary (e.g., structures compiled into the binary), or newly created types (created using the create factory methods of the corresponding type classes described later in the section) that are added to SymtabAPI by the user. 

As described in Section 2.2, this class serves as a base class for all the other classes in this interface. An object of this class is returned from type look up operations performed through the Symtab class described in Section 6. The user can then obtain the specific type object from the generic Type class object. The following example shows how to get the specific object from a given Type object returned as part of a look up operation.

\begin{lstlisting}
//Example shows how to retrieve a structure type object from a given ``Type'' object
using namespace Dyninst;
using namespace SymtabAPI;

//Obj represents a handle to a parsed object file using symtabAPI
//Find a structure type in the object file
Type *structType = obj->findType(``structType1'');

// Get the specific typeStruct object
typeStruct *stType = structType->isStructType();
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{apient}
string &getName()
\end{apient}
\apidesc{
This method returns the name associated with this type.
Each of the types is represented by a symbolic name. This method retrieves the
name for the type. For example, in the example above structType1
represents the name for the structType object.
}

\begin{apient}
bool setName(string zname)
\end{apient}
\apidesc{
This method sets the name of this type to name. Returns true on success and false on failure.
}

    dataCommon,
    dataScalar,
    dataTypeDefine,
    dataReference,
    dataUnknownType,

    dataTypeClass
} dataClass;
\end{apient}

\begin{apient}
dataClass getType()
\end{apient}
\apidesc{
This method returns the data class associated with the type. 
This value should be used to convert this generic type object to a specific type object which offers more functionality by using the corresponding query function described later in this section. For example, if this method returns dataStructure then the isStructureType() should be called to dynamically cast the Type object to the typeStruct object.
}

\begin{apient}
typeId_t getID()
\end{apient}
\apidesc{
This method returns the ID associated with this type.
